    "text": "The TCGA Data Analysis with R course is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively analyze and interpret data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the R programming language. TCGA is a valuable resource for cancer researchers, providing comprehensive genomic and clinical data on various cancer types. This course will cover essential concepts, tools, and techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, and data visualization using R. Participants will gain hands-on experience by working with real TCGA datasets and will learn to derive meaningful insights from complex cancer genomics data.\n\n\n\nIntroduce you to the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data available at the NCI’s Genomic Data Commons (GDC).\nDemonstrate how to access and import TCGA data using the R/Bioconductor package TCGAbiolinks (Colaprico et al. 2015).\nProvide instruction to visualize copy number alteration and mutation data using the R/Bioconductor package maftools.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic knowledge of R syntax\nUnderstand the pipe operator (“%&gt;%”) (help material https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html)\nUnderstand the SummarizedExperiment data structure (help material http://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment/)\n\n\n\n\nThe course will be delivered through a combination of lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and interactive discussions. Participants will have access to real TCGA datasets and will be guided through step-by-step analysis using R. Additionally, participants will be provided with relevant learning resources, including code examples and data repositories, to support their learning outside the course hours."

    "text": "Q1: Q1: What is TCGA?\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a large-scale collaborative project that aimed to comprehensively characterize genomic and molecular alterations in various types of cancer. It provided an extensive collection of multi-omics data, including gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, copy number variation, and clinical information for thousands of tumor samples across multiple cancer types.\nQ2: What types of data are available in TCGA?\nTCGA offers a diverse range of data types, including gene expression data, DNA methylation data, microRNA expression data, copy number variation data, somatic mutation data, and clinical information such as patient demographics, tumor stage, treatment information, and survival outcomes.\nQ3: How can I access TCGA data using R?\nYou can access TCGA data using R through the TCGAbiolinks package. TCGAbiolinks provides functionalities to download and preprocess TCGA data directly from the TCGA data portal, allowing you to quickly access and analyze the datasets in R.\nQ4: What are some common R packages used in TCGA data analysis?\nSome common R packages used in TCGA data analysis include TCGAbiolinks (for data retrieval and preprocessing), dplyr (for data manipulation), ggplot2 (for data visualization), limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 (for differential gene expression analysis), and survival and survminer (for survival analysis).\nQ5: Can I integrate multiple data types from TCGA in my analysis?\nYes, you can integrate multiple data types from TCGA, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. Integrating multiple omics data types can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer.\nQ6: Do I need prior knowledge of cancer biology to take this course?\nWhile prior knowledge of cancer biology is recommended, it is not a strict requirement. The course assumes some familiarity with genomics concepts and R programming. Basic explanations of cancer biology concepts relevant to the analysis will be provided during the course.\nQ7: How will the course be conducted? The course will be a combination of lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and interactive discussions. Participants will have access to real TCGA datasets and will be guided through step-by-step analysis using R.\nQ8: What will be the format of the practical sessions? The practical sessions will involve working with real TCGA datasets in R. Participants will be given coding exercises and tutorials to practice data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using R.\nQ9: Will the course cover best practices for reproducible research? Yes, the course will emphasize the importance of reproducible research. Participants will be introduced to best practices for documenting their analysis and code to ensure transparency and replicability of their findings.\nQ10: Can I apply the skills learned in the course to my own research projects?\nAbsolutely! The skills and knowledge gained from the course can be directly applied to independent research projects involving TCGA data analysis. Participants will be well-equipped to continue their analysis beyond the scope of the course."

Use a link below to launch download of R installers (if the download does not start, a fix may be to copy-paste the below link to your browser):\n\nFor Mac users: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\nFor Windows users: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.3-win.exe\nFor Ubuntu users: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/\n\nFor other operating systems, or if you prefer to access the download link from the official website, visit http://cran.us.r-project.org and select Download R for Linux, Download R for macOS or Download R for Windows based on which device you have.\nOnce the proper installation package has been selected, run the package and follow the on-screen directions. This installation includes the R language and a graphical user interface (GUI). Rather using the GUI, we recommend installing RStudio - an integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you interact with R with some added benefits."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe ELMER pipeline provided valuable insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC). The integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data revealed differentially methylated enhancer regions linked to changes in gene expression, potentially contributing to KIRC pathogenesis. The identified candidate enhancer-gene pairs and enriched biological pathways may serve as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for further investigation. This study highlights the significance of epigenetic mechanisms in cancer biology and provides a foundation for future research in KIRC epigenomics. However, further validation and functional studies are required to establish the clinical relevance of the findings and their potential implications for KIRC treatment and prognosis."
